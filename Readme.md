## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/marcusandre/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    $ cd ~/.dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh

  * ```Homebrew``` is a package manager for OSX (if you are on a Mac and have not already installed this tool on your computer.)
  * ```nvm``` is a simple bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions.
  * ```z``` tracks your most used directories and jumps into them.
  * ```watch``` executes a given command periodically.
