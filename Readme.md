  Please feel free to fork or contribute.

## Installation

    $ ./install # or

## Preparation

You'll need [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage these dotfiles with ease.

> GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct packages of software
> and/or data located in separate directories on the filesystem, and makes them
> appear to be installed in the same place. For example, /usr/local/bin could
> contain symlinks to files within /usr/local/stow/emacs/bin,
> /usr/local/stow/perl/bin etc., and likewise recursively for any other
> subdirectories such as .../share, .../man, and so on.

It sings in my ears.

macOS users would install stow via: ```brew install stow```.
